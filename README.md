This project aims to analyze the trends and patterns of temporary visa holders in Australia using two datasets obtained from the [Department of Home Affairs](https://data.gov.au/search?organisation=Department%20of%20Home%20Affairs).

## Datasets

1. [Temporary Visa Holders - Major Group, 2013-2023](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-2515b21d-0dba-4810-afd4-ac8dd92e873e/details?q=)
2. [Temporary Visa Holders - Visa Subclass, 2019-2023](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-ab245863-4dea-4661-a334-71ee15937130/details?q=)

## Analysis

The Jupyter notebook provided in this repository offers a comprehensive analysis of the datasets. The analysis includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Data visualization using bar plots, line plots, and heatmaps.
- Exploration of trends and patterns in temporary visa holders across Australian states and territories.
- Analysis of visa subclasses and major occupation groups.

## Conclusions

This project provides insights into the distribution and trends of temporary visa holders in Australia, revealing valuable information for policy-making, migration services, and individuals interested in understanding the Australian migration landscape.
